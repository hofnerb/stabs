Description: Resampling procedures to assess the stability of selected variables
    with additional finite sample error control for high-dimensional variable
    selection procedures such as Lasso or boosting. Both, standard stability
    selection (Meinshausen & Buhlmann, 2010, <doi:10.1111/j.1467-9868.2010.00740.x>) 
    and complementary pairs stability selection with improved error bounds 
    (Shah & Samworth, 2013, <doi:10.1111/j.1467-9868.2011.01034.x>) are
    implemented. The package can be combined with arbitrary user specified
    variable selection approaches.
