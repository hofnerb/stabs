Description: Resampling procedures to assess the stability of selected variables
    with additional finite sample error control for high-dimensional variable
    selection procedures such as Lasso or boosting. Both, standard stability
    selection (Meinshausen & BÃ¼hlmann, 2010) and complementarty pairs stability
    selection with improved error bounds (Shah & Samworth, 2013) are
    implemented. The package can be combined with arbitrary user specified
    variable selection approaches.
